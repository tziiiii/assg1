# FED Assg1 - My Bloody Valentine Band Website
I made a website for the band known as My Bloody Valentine. It includes pictures, music videos, upcoming show dates, vinyl prices as well as social media links. This gives fans that want to learn more about them easier access to information about the band. The website is user friendly and provides ease of access such as a navigation bar at the top to navigate between sections as well as an option to choose which vinyl prices they would like to view so that they can compare between 1 or 2 without having to view all of them at the same time. With all this information put together in a manner in which it is easy to view, fans can find information about the band efficiently.

## Design Process
I made this website to make it easier for all types of users to find information regarding the band that they require as efficiently as possible and layed out in a way that is easy to digest.
User stotries:
As a fan, I want to be able to view all the tour information in one place as I would like to find out when the next performing dates are and their location. 
As a business, I want to be able to know where to contact the band via social media so that i can make any business inquiries.
As a concert manager, I want to be able to see pictures of what their past concerts look like so that I can tailor upcoming concerts to their liking.
As a vinyl collector, I would like to be able to see all the available vinyls as well as their prices so that I can add them to my collection and compare their prices with other sources.

# Features
Feature 1: Navigation Bar at the top which allows ease of access between sections

Feature 5: 2 Music Videos embedded
Feature 6: Checkbox filter which allows users to pick which album descriptions and prices they would like to view for easy comparisons
Feature 7: 4 social media icons at the footer with hyperlinks to instagram, youtube, twitter and facebook.
Feature left to implement:

# Testing
1.Social Media Links
i.Click on Socials in the navigation bar
ii.Try clicking on each of the 4 social media icons
2.Shop Filter
i.Click on Shop in the navigation bar
ii.Check all checkboxes and verify all vinyls are displayed
iii.Remove 1 or 2 and verify that it has been removed

Bugs:
Had trouble with navigation bar staying at the top while scrolling, sometimes other elements would overlap it.
Had trouble configuring the checkbox filter, sometimes elements would still show even when box was checked.
